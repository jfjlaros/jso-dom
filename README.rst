JavaScript Object to DOM
========================

This library makes the creation of (part of) a Document Object Model (DOM)
easier by providing a function that converts a nested JavaScript Object (JSO)
to a DOM. This eliminates the need for manual element and text creation,
hierarchical placement of elements, attribute setting and configuration of
callback functions, resulting in more readable and compact code.

This library was originally developed for Greasemonkey_ user scripts, but it
should be usable in any JavaScript program that runs in a browser.
